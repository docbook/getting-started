* Getting started
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
:END:

The goal of this repository is to build some easy to follow “getting
started” templates for various DocBook uses.

It’s still a work in progress.

There are currently three examples:

** book
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: book
:END:

The [[tree/master/book][book]] example demonstrate formatting a book:

+ As a single HTML page
+ As a set of pages (chapters, sections, etc.)
+ As an EPUB (with additional media and other resources)
+ For print with either AntennaHouse or PrinceXML.

** weblog and website
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: weblog
:END:

The [[tree/master/weblog][weblog]] and [[tree/master/website][website]] examples are a little less complete. The
principle difference is that the weblog example collates the whole
site and can publish a reverse chronological index.
